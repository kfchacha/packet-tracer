  ### IMPLEMENTATION.
   
   We executed this project as per the floor plan of the main building with switches on each floor establishing communication to the routers thus enabling cross network communication. This is achieved through multi-layer switches because they can perform routing functions at high speeds and inspect deeper into the protocol description unit. This is useful in networks where there is a need for faster routing and switching.

   #### CONFIGURATION STEPS.

   1. basic settings to all devices plus ssh on the routers plus 13 switches.
   2. VLANS assignments plus all access and trunk reports.
   3. Switchport security to all 13 networks.
   4. Subnetting and I.P addressing.
   5. OSPF on all routers and switches.
   6. Static IP addressing to server room devices
   7. DHCP server configurations.
   8. Inter- VLAN routing on all switches and ip dhcp helper addresses.
   9. Wireless network configurations.
   10. Verifying and Testing the network.
   
   ### CONSTRAINTS.

   The constraints that were faced during development include lack of knowledge about networking protocols such as OSPF which was introduced later than others like TCP
   You, being very cautious, decide to simulate the topology on Cisco Packet Tracer in order to optimally design the network considering the number of devices (switches, routers etc.) used to maximize the profit margins of your company.
